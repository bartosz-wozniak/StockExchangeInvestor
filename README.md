This thesis entitled "Computer system to aid investing at the Warsaw Stock Exchange" aimed to
verify effectiveness of chosen elements of technical analysis, namely technical indicators, in stock
investing. As a part of this thesis, a web application was created which meets the aforementioned
requirements. The users of the application can create an account and view stock charts. The key
features include a module that allows users to perform a simulation of a defined investment
strategy and a module designed to manage an investment wallet. The analysis of simulationsâ€™
results has been made to investigate whether using only technical indicators can be an effective
method of investment strategy planning.
